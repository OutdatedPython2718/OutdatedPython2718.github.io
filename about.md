I'm a AI Cybersecurity Engineer for the MITRE Corporation whose spent the last several year spliting my time between researching various cybersecurity topics, building tools to automate data collection and analysis, and developing backend services.

I'm technical and to the point. Nothing makes me happier than perfectly linted code with a properly formatted markdown file.

My hobbies:

- Disc golf
- Hiking
- Chess
- Table top games
- Trading card games
- Old School Runescape

Sometimes I do some cool stuff [like making a discord bot](https://github.com/OutdatedPython2718/ashen-bot/tree/main)[^1]

It's hard to boil down someones entire life into a single, concise about me page, but I think this just about does it. In the case you want to know more feel free to contact me. Email's at the bottom of the page. Cheers.
